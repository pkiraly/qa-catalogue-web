## The major features of this release

### Improved PICA handling
PICA is an alternative bibliographic metadata schema used in Germany, The Netherlands and France. The development of
PICA related features were done in cooperation with K10Plus, the largest union catalogue of Germany. Now the analyses
of PICA records covers completeness, validation, subject heading and authority name analyses plus searching and
displaying individual records.

### Handling union catalogues
Union catalogues covers the collections of multiple libraries. Now QA catalogue could display the results of
completeness, validation, searching and term list for both the whole catalogue and for any individual library.

### Translation
The main parts of the user interface are translatable and the code contains German and Brazilian Portuguese
translations thanks to Jakob Voß (VZG) and Tiago Murakami (Universidade de São Paulo).

### SHACL4bib
Shape Expression Constraints Language (SHACL) has been adapted to MARC and PICA records. It provides a customized
analysis for a library, so it can write a configuration file to check records against their own customs and ruleset
which are not part of the core standard. This feature was party developed by Jean Michel Nzi Mba as part of his
Bachelor thesis.

### Other features
QA catalogue makes use of a Composer based setup to manage dependencies. It also has improved downloading
functionalities, so the user can download all IDs that bound to any particular issue, or fit to search terms.
The menu system has been improved. In term lists the user can type MARC/PICA codes and substrib or their labels
instead of Solr field name (as previously).

## Contributors
In the creation of this release Jakob Voß, Tiago Murakami and Jean Michel Nzi Mba provided important contributions.
